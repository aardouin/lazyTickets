# lazyTickets

A script to generate scrum tickets from a backlog

# Usage

I assume you already have a backlog with the correct format. 

First you need to export this `backlog.numbers` into csv files

Then you you must simply run 
```bash
lazytickets -s S1 -f backlog.csv
```

 - `-s` option must match the sprint tag you want to export. It is used in the first coloumn of the backlog.
 - `-f` option indicates the csv file to parse
 - `--singleTaskStories` option indicates that you want to print tasks for stories with only one task #DEPRECATED
 - `--no-singleTaskStories`  option indicates that you don't want to print tasks for stories with only one task, instead, the task TAG is added to the story **(Default behavior)** #DEPRECATED

 
The output files will be `tickets_i.jpg` and will be placed on the folder you executed the script.
